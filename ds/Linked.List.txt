Data Structures is
* Defining custom data types and their operations.
* Memory Management (Allocation, Use, Deallocation)
* Applying algorithms to solve problems.
=======================================
Linked List
-----------
A linked list is a linear data structure
formed by a collection of homogenous
units called as nodes.

A node is a secondary datatype
formed by combining DATA and 
LINK to next node.

What is a linear data structure?
A linear data structure is the one
that arranges its elements sequentially.

Being linear and a collection of
homogemous units a linked list
resembles an array.

Advantages of linked list over array
--------------------------------
* Dyanmic expansion and shrink support
* Customized life

Advantages of array over linked list
--------------------------------
* Easy creation
* Supports direct access of any element.
* Uses less memory for storing same number of values.

Group A (Mandatory)
1. A Vegetable and Fruit Mall wants to organize its vegetables and fruit products in a combination of purchase
pattern of customers. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures. Design necessary class.
2. A Dictionary stores keywords & its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting keywords,
& updating values of any entry. Also provide facility to display whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending
order, Also find how many maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Make use of
appropriate data structures.
3. A news paper delivery boy every day drops news paper in a society having many lanes & each lane have
many houses. Design a program to provide different paths that he could follow & also suggest the path which
will make him to finish his task with less effort. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures.
Design necessary class.
4. Extending to problem 2. Consider dictionary data is stored in a file in random order. Thus, to search any
the word & its meanings from given data, program should create reasonably balanced tree.

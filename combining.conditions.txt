Combining Conditions
-------------------
C supports combination of multiple
conditions and formation of a single
boolean result by use of operators
 * Logical And : &&
 * Logical Or : ||

When multiple conditions are encountered
then 
1) System evaluates all (or may have a short circuit)
2) Clubs the conditions in order
   * Logical And First
   * Logical Or Next
3) Forms one result of clubbing the 
conditions based on following TRUTH 
TABLES. 

TRUTH TABLE For Logical AND
	T && T = T
	T && F = F
	F && T = F
	F && F = F

TRUTH TABLE For Logical OR
	T || T = T
	T || F = T
	F || T = T
	F || F = F

System executes one statement once,
if the need is of repeatative execution 
of some set of statements then 
those must be enclosed in a loop.

Loop
-----
A loop is a mechanism used to 
repeat the execution of a set 
of statements, multiple times.

A loop is always governed by a
condition.

System repeats the set of statements 
inside a loop, as long as the governing
condition remains true.

Types of Loop
--------------
C supports 3 types of loop
1) while
2) for
3) do while

All are used for repeatation of
program statements.

But they have an essential differnce.

* "for" and "while" loop will execute
the set of statements ZERO to
MANY times.

* "do while" loop will execute
the set of statements ONE to
MANY times.

Loop Related Terms
--------------------
Initialization : The start value
assigned to a loop controlling
variable.

Condition : The stop value for 
the loop controlling variable.

Reinitialization : Is the change in 
value of the loop controlling
variable.

Cycle/Iteration : Is one execution
of statements in loop body.

Syntax while loop
-------------------
initialization
while(condition)
{
  statements to repeat
  reinitialization
}

syntax for loop
----------------
     1)             2) 5) 8)   4) 7)
for(initialization; condition; reinitialization)
{//on true
  3) 6)
  statements to repeat
}
on false 9)

Syntax do-while loop
-------------------

initialization 1)

do
{ 2) on true 5) 8)
  statements to repeat
  reinitialization 3) 6) 9)
}while(condition); 4) 7) 10)
on false 11) 


To Design A Loop 
----------------
1) Analyze the statements to be
repeated.
2) Analyze the repeatation count.
Hence analyze :
  * start value
  * stop value
  * change in value
3) Select a loop (for/while/do while)
4) Write the code

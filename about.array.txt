Array
------
An array is a collection of variables
of same datatype.
It is used to represent homogenous
set of information.

Memory Allocation
-----------------
A continuous block of memory is
allocated for the array.
It is splitted into identical units
called as "array elements".

Array Access
-------------
The array has a unique name for 
accessibility.
The array elements are auto applied
a zero based sequential and ascending 
index.

To access an array means to read
or write its elements.
This is done by a combination of
   "arrayName[elementIndex]"

Array Access Tip 
It is recommended to access the
array elements within the boundaries.

Declaration
-----------
To declare an array :

Syntax :
 datatype arrayName[arraySize];

Example :
 int arr1[5];
 float arr2[3];

Rules : 
 datatype : can be any primary / secondary type other than void.
 arrayName : any valid name as for variables.
 arraySize : 
  * must be a whole number  
     float arr[3.1]; is illegal
  * must be a constant value
     int x = 5; 
     int arr[x]; is illegal
  * must be min 1 in size
     int arr[-3]; is illegal
    Certain systems allow array
    to be size 0, but such an array
    will be "unusable", so minimum
    size of array for it to be usable
    is one.
    Maximum size of array is system dependent. 

Tip
-----
   To read/write/process an array
   means to read/write/process its
   elements.

   Use loops to work on arrays.

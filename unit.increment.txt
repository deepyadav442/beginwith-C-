Study of unit increment operator : ++
---------------------------------
++ is a unary operator.
++ increments the value of its operand
(variable) by one.


Example1:
----------
a is 10
a++
a becomes 11

System supports application of ++ in
two forms 
* Prefix  : ++a
* Postfix : a++

In both the forms the operator has
the same affect.
i.e. will increment the operand by one.

Example2:
----------
a is 10
++a
a becomes 11


What is the difference between prefix
and postfix usage of ++?

Known that ++ can be used in prefix
and postfix form.
And both the applications increment
the operand by one.
But they differ in their priority.

Prefix usage of ++ is highest in priority.
Postfix usage of ++ is least in priority.

Example1:
-----------
int a, b;
a = 10;
b = a++ * 5; //a*5, result in b , a unit increment
result :
a : 11
b : 50

Example2:
-----------
int a, b;
a = 10;
b = ++a * 5; //a unit increment, a*5, result in b
result :
a : 11
b : 55

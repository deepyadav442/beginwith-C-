Stream
--------
A stream is a software entity that
allows transfer of information.

Classification
------------
A stream may be 
* Unidirectional
* Bidirectional

A unidirectional stream allows one
way data transfer and may be an
input stream or an output stream.

A bidirectional stream allows two 
way data transfer and will be an
input-output stream.

Operations
----------
A stream must be
* Opened
* Read/Written
* Closed.

3 Special Streams
-----------------
OS opens and manages 3 special
streams:
* Standard Input Stream : Channel of data transfer between Keyboard and CPU
(Refered as "stdin" in C)

* Standard Output Stream : Channel of data transfer between CPU and Monitor
(Refered as "stdout" in C)

* Standard Error Stream : Channel of data transfer between CPU and Monitor
(Refered as "stderr" in C)

OS makes these streams available to
the active application.
An application must utilize the streams.

An active C application uses predefined
functions like "scanf", "printf", ... 
to utilize "stdin" and "stdout" streams.

Sequential search is comparison 
of a target value against elements
of a sequential data structure 
like array/linked list.

It begins comparison of target value
with the first element of array or
linked list.

It compares all the elements 
sequentially (one after the other)
and tries to find an equivalent.

It stops :
* On match found 
* Entire array/linked list gets compared.

If a match is found it returns
the index of matching element.
But if match is not found it returns
-1 or NULL (a flag value indicating
not found).

Access
-------
To access means to use.
Say to access a variable means to
use (read/write) it.
And a variable is accessible (usable)
* By name.
* By memory location.

Accessing a variable by its name is
the common practice.
And it supports read/write operations
on the variable.

Accessing a variable by its memory
location requires following :
1) Fetch the address of the variable.
2) Store it in a pointer.
3) Dereference the pointer to read/write the variable.


Pointers
--------
A pointer is a variable that can 
* store memory location (address) 
* be derefenced to access that location.
